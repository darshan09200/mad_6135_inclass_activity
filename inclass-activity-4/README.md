hardcode 4 arrays with string of random english
every array will have 15 words
1 => 3 letter words
2 => 4L
3 => 5L
4 => 6L

3 lives

show lives

multiple levels

each level selects words from start to level index in array
it will drop and you have to type before it reaches bottom
no of words = no of points
speed starts with slow and increase with each level
each level finishes with 10 successful word

after the last level increase the speed by 10% until the player looses

maintain high score

randomize case after 2 more levels after level 4 (my suggestion)
